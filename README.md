# MI Developer Test

You have just been hired as a mobile developer in a new company.

On your first day, our CTO wants you to spend some time on a project.
The objective is very simple: you need to create a showcase application that can download and parse AT THE SAME TIME the history of the versions of Android and some device informations. Creating a database and storing the data is a plus. Once the download is finished, you need to display both information in a listview on the main screen. 

Once you open the app, you can select a device by tapping on it, which will show the related android version information (name, version code).

You also need to add a Plus (+) button to add a new field directly from the application. The server is a basic restFull server, so you can easily POST new info. 

## How to GET and POST the data?
We deployed on our side the "JSON Server" from Typicode [<a href='https://github.com/typicode/json-server'>Github</a>]</br />
Server access: <a href='http://mobilesandboxdev.azurewebsites.net/'>http://mobilesandboxdev.azurewebsites.net/</a>. There is no landing page.</br />
DataBase :  <a href='https://github.com/massiveinfinity/mi-dev-test/blob/master/database.json'>database</a><br />
Check out the Json Server documentation to see how to get the related informations.

## We want to know if you can 
- Create an scalable app
- Use a RestFul server (GET / POST). Create the PUT and DELETE will be a plus
- Use GIT
- Apply User-friendly/Intuitive UI

Multithreading is a plus.

## How to submit your work?
Fork this repository. This exercise should take about 2 days. However, you are not timed and you can send us a pull request whenever you are ready to show us your work.
And if you have something live going on, even better!
